**OpenUI5 OData V4 Model**

The new version of the OpenUI5 OData V4 model introduces the following features:

-   If the parent context of an operation binding is a row context of a list binding, and the result of the operation fulfills the criteria for a return value context, you can now replace that row context with the result of the operation. For more information, see the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#execute` method, and in particular the `bReplaceWithRVC` parameter.

-   We have introduced the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#replaceWith` method. You can use it to replace a row context of a list binding by a kept-alive context that is not part of the collection. Such a context can be kept alive with the `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.Context#setKeepAlive` method introduced with OpenUI5 1.81.

-   You can now apply the `sort`, `filter`, `changeParameters`, and `suspend` methods to an `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding` despite changes in kept-alive contexts or bindings relative to kept-alive contexts of the list. Accordingly, `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#hasPendingChanges` has been extended with a `bIgnoreKeptAlive` parameter.

-   The `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#filter` and `sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataListBinding#sort` methods do not reset the binding if the filters or sorters are unchanged.

**`sap.m.DatePicker, sap.m.DateRangeSelection, sap.m.DateTimePicker, and sap.m.TimePicker`**

These controls can now be opened by another control. To enable this feature, we have introduced a new `hideInput` property that hides the input field of the corresponding control. In this case, the only way to open the picker popover is by calling the `openBy` method. This new feature minimizes the visual footprint of the controls, which is useful when more controls are placed together. For more information, see the [DatePicker](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.DatePicker/sample/sap.m.sample.DatePickerHidden), [DateRangeSelection](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.DateRangeSelection/sample/sap.m.sample.DateRangeSelectionHidden), [DateTimePicker](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.DateTimePicker/sample/sap.m.sample.DateTimePickerHidden), and [TimePicker](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.m.TimePicker/sample/sap.m.sample.TimePickerHidden) samples.
