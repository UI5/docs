## Overview of Instantiation Mechanisms

OpenUI5 offers several mechanisms for component instantiation, each suited for different scenarios:

-   **`ComponentSupport` Module** - A declarative approach for initial application components.
-   **Routing with Nested Components** - The routing definition allows for navigation-based creation and rendering of *nested* components.
-   **`Component.create()` Factory Function** - A modern factory function. This is the recommended approach for programmatic component creation with full application control and responsibility. It requires a `ComponentContainer` to render.
-   **`Component#createComponent()` Factory Function** - The recommended approach to create a *reuse component* defined in an application component's `manifest.json`. It also requires a `ComponentContainer` to render.
-   **`ComponentContainer`** - A container element for rendering components. It can load and instantiate a component and accepts any other programmatically created component, such as those created via `Component.create()` or `Component#createComponent`.

***

<a name="loio346599f0890d4dfaaa11c6b4ffa96312__section_COF"/>

## Component Factories

OpenUI5 provides two modern component factories:

-   **`Component.create()`**
-   **`Component#createComponent()`**

This section outlines the usage of the `Component.create()` API, as it is the most flexible and versatile way to create a component instance. Keep in mind that the full responsibility for component orchestration and rendering lies with the application.

1.  **`Component.create()`**

    The static `Component.create()` factory allows you to pass the name of a component along with additional options like the URL for a `manifest.json`. The return value of this factory is a Promise that resolves with the final component instance once it is fully constructed.

    > ### Note:  
    > For more information on the manifest, see [Manifest First Function](manifest-descriptor-for-applications-components-and-libraries-be0cf40.md#loiobe0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da__manifirst).

    ```js
    // Basic factory call
    const oBasicComponent = await Component.create({
        name: "sap.my.component",
    });
    ```

    You can also pass a dedicated URL for the `manifest.json` to the factory function. In this case, the URL must point directly to the `manifest.json` and must be resolved by the caller:

    ```js
    // Creating a Component with a manifest URL
    const oComponentWithManifestURL = await Component.create({
        name: "sap.my.component",
        manifest: "any/location/sap/my/component/manifest.json"
    });
    ```

2.  **`Component#createComponent()`**

    The `Component#createComponent()` factory is explained below in [Nesting Components](component-instantiation-guide-346599f.md#loio346599f0890d4dfaaa11c6b4ffa96312__section_NCP).

<a name="loio346599f0890d4dfaaa11c6b4ffa96312__section_INM"/>

## Choosing the Right Instantiation Mechanism

The table below shows the recommended approach for each scenario. We recommend initializing the first application component via the `ComponentSupport` in the initial HTML page. If needed, you can also create a component programmatically using the `Component.create()` factory method in combination with a `ComponentContainer`. All recommended approaches support optimized manifest-first loading.

> ### Caution:  
> Do not use deprecated legacy mechanisms! For completeness, we mention the deprecated `sap.ui.component()` synchronous factory function. **We strongly advise against using this function.**

The modern approaches offers several significant advantages:

-   **Asynchronous loading** prevents blocking the UI thread.
-   **Manifest-first** loading optimizes dependency resolution and early model loading and creation.
-   **Promise-based** APIs allow for manual orchestration and error handling.
-   **Future-proof**, as synchronous requests are deprecated by all major browsers and are no longer available in legacy-free variants of OpenUI5.

## Initial Components

The following sections outline the recommended ways for instantiating the initial application component. For a detailed guide on creating nested components and subdividing your application, see [Nesting Components](component-instantiation-guide-346599f.md#loio346599f0890d4dfaaa11c6b4ffa96312__section_NCP).

***

### `ComponentSupport` - Declarative Approach

The `ComponentSupport` module enables declarative component instantiation directly in HTML, making it the recommended approach for initial application components.

**Good to know:**

-   **HTML is case-insensitive:** Properties and settings of a component are defined in camelCase. In HTML, you need to specify them with hyphens, e.g. `data-handle-validation` for `handleValidation`.
-   **Automatic optimization:** The `ComponentSupport` enforces manifest-first loading and asynchronous behavior by default.
-   **Lifecycle management:** By default, the lifecycle management is configured to be `Container`. See [`sap.ui.core.ComponentLifecycle`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.ComponentLifecycle) and the section about `ComponentContainer`s below.

For samples regarding the `ComponentSupport`, see [Declarative API for Initial Components](declarative-api-for-initial-components-82a0fce.md).

**Setup and Usage**

Enable `ComponentSupport` in your bootstrap:

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script id="sap-ui-bootstrap"
    src="resources/sap-ui-core.js"
    data-sap-ui-on-init="module:sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport"
    data-sap-ui-async="true"
    data-sap-ui-resource-roots='{ "my.app": "./" }'
    data-...="...">
</script>
```

You now can declaratively define components directly in HTML using data attributes on a container DOM element \(in this sample a `<div>` element\):

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<body id="content" class="sapUiBody sapUiSizeCompact" role="application">
    <div data-sap-ui-component
        data-id="myRootComponentContainer"
        data-name="my.app"
        data-height="100%"
        data-settings='{ "id": "myRootComponent" }'
        data-handle-validation="true"
        data-...="...">
    </div>
</body>
```

For more information, see the [API Reference: `module:sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/module:sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport).

**Advanced Usage**

For scenarios requiring a pre-initialization setup, you can use a dedicated `init` module and manually load the `ComponentSupport`. Once loaded, it automatically detects any declarative component definition in the HTML page's DOM \(see the sample above\).

```html
<script id="sap-ui-bootstrap"
    data-sap-ui-on-init="module:my/app/startupEfforts"
    ...>
</script>
```

```js
// my/app/startupEfforts.js
sap.ui.define(["my/app/MyModule"], (MyModule) => {
    "use strict";
    // Execute prerequisite code, e.g. loading additional application data, connecting to back-end services, etc.
    MyModule.init().then(() =>
        sap.ui.require(["sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport"])
    );
});
```

***

### `ComponentContainer` - Programmatic Approach

Sometimes you need to programmatically create a component and render it in a specific part of the application or HTML page. For these use cases, we provide a `ComponentContainer` control, which has a special `component` association that holds the reference to the component instance.

> ### Note:  
> You cannot use `placeAt()` directly on components - they must always be wrapped in a `ComponentContainer`.

`ComponentContainer`s offer several features:

-   **Lifecycle management:** They forward lifecycle methods \(`onBeforeRendering`, `onAfterRendering`\) to their associated component.
-   **Separation:** They decouple the control tree and data binding between parent and child components. A component within a `ComponentContainer` has no parent control. The `Component#getParent()` function returns `null`, even though the `ComponentContainer` itself is aggregated in the control tree.
-   **Model propagation:** Despite the strict separation mentioned above, setting the `propagateModel` property to `true` forwards models and binding contexts to the associated component. By default, a component within a `ComponentContainer` doesn't participate in the model propagation process.
-   **Rendering context:** They provide the necessary wrapper for component rendering.

**Using `ComponentContainer`s**

**Method 1: Container-managed component creation**

```js
// "ComponentContainer" required from module "sap/ui/core/ComponentContainer"
var oContainer = new ComponentContainer({
    name: "samples.components.sample",
    manifest: true
});
oContainer.placeAt("target");
```

**Method 2: Pre-created component association**

```js
// "Component" required from module "sap/ui/core/Component"
// "ComponentContainer" required from module "sap/ui/core/ComponentContainer"
Component.create({
    name: "samples.components.sample",
}).then(function(oComponent) {
    // Note: the Component instance (oComponent) is only associated in the ComponentContainer, not aggregated!
    var oContainer = new ComponentContainer({
        component: oComponent
    });
    oContainer.placeAt("target");
});
```

**Lifecycle Management**

The `ComponentContainer` lets you define a `lifecycle` of a component and how it aligns with the lifecylce of the container.For more information, see the [API Reference: `sap.ui.core.ComponentLifecycle`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.ComponentLifecycle).

> ### Note:  
> The default is `sap.ui.core.ComponentLifecycle.Legacy`.

```js
// "ComponentContainer" required from module "sap/ui/core/ComponentContainer"
// "coreLibrary" required from module "sap/ui/core/library"
var oContainer = new ComponentContainer({
    name: "samples.components.sample",
    lifecycle: coreLibrary.ComponentLifecycle.Container,
    manifest: true
});
```

## Nesting Components

Nesting components lets you subdivide your application into smaller, independent parts. Each part has its own dedicated set of dependencies and resources. For example, in a shop application that displays a list of products, the editing functionality should only be visible to administrators. It doesn't need to be loaded for other users. Nested components help you decouple this functionality. This approach reduces the initial payload needed to start your main component, improving application startup performance and resource utilization.

You can nest components in these ways:

-   [Routing with Nested Components](component-instantiation-guide-346599f.md#loio346599f0890d4dfaaa11c6b4ffa96312__RWNC): You can implement this with targets of `Component` type. This method is recommended for most use cases. Use it when nested components have routing enabled. It's crucial when routing is used within nested components, as it prevents conflicts that could arise when multiple components react to the same browser hash change.
-   [Programmatic Instantiation](component-instantiation-guide-346599f.md#loio346599f0890d4dfaaa11c6b4ffa96312__PI): You can achieve this by declaring your component in the `sap.ui5/componentUsages` section of your parent component's `manifest.json` and creating it using a factory function.

***

### Manifest Configuration

Before configuring nested components via routing or instantiating them programmatically, declare them in the `sap.ui5/componentUsages` section of your parent component's `manifest.json`:

```json
{
    "sap.ui5": {
        "componentUsages": {
            "myreuse": {
                "name": "sap.reuse.component",
                "settings": {},
                "componentData": {},
                "lazy": false
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Configuration Options:**

-   **`name`:** Component identifier \(mandatory\)
-   **`settings`:** Component-specific settings
-   **`componentData`:** Data passed to the component's constructor
-   **`lazy`:** Controls the preloading behavior \(`false` = preload, `true` = load on demand\)

***

### Routing With Nested Components

Nesting components with target-based navigation is the recommended way to achieve a separation of concerns. This approach is especially important when routing is used within nested components, as it prevents conflicts that could arise when multiple components react to the same browser hash change.

Using routing with nested components requires:

-   **Asynchronous routing** enabled in all components
-   **Component target** configuration in the parent routing
-   **Proper `componentUsages`** declaration

For more information, see [Enabling Routing in Nested Components](enabling-routing-in-nested-components-fb19f50.md).

**Routing Configuration \(`manifest.json`\):**

-   **`type: "Component"`:** Indicates that the framework's routing should instantiate a component
-   **`usage`:** References the key from `componentUsages` in the `manifest.json`
-   **`options`:** Additional options for the component. This object merges with the corresponding object from the `componentUsages` section of the `manifest.json`.
-   **`containerOptions`:** Additional options passed to the `ComponentContainer`'s constructor

> ### Note:  
> The routing configuration also provides a `"View"` target type.
> 
> When multiple components have their own routing configuration, their individual routers coordinate hash access to prevent conflicts. This allows for sub-routing and ensures deterministic navigation across the component hierarchy.
> 
> For more information, see [Routing Configuration](routing-configuration-9023130.md).

```json
{
    "sap.ui5": {
        "componentUsages": {
            "myreuse": {
                "name": "reuse.component",
                "lazy": false
            }
        },
        "routing": {
            "config": {
                "async": true
            },
            "routes": [{
                "name": "componentRoute",
                "pattern": "component",
                "target": "componentTarget"
            }],
            "targets": {
                "componentTarget": {
                    "type": "Component",
                    "usage": "myreuse",
                    "options": {
                        // Additional component options
                    },
                    "containerOptions": {
                        // ComponentContainer options
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

***

### Programmatic Instantiation

In certain scenarios, programmatic component instantiation is required, such as opening a dialog component when a user performs a specific action. The `Component` class provides a factory function to asynchronously create reuse components that are declared in the manifest. While this approach requires additional application code, it offers greater control and flexibility, allowing you to precisely orchestrate the loading and instantiation of nested components.

**Simplified usage:**

```js
const oComponent = await this.createComponent("myreuse");
```

**Extended usage:**

```js
const oComponent = await this.createComponent({
    usage: "myreuse",
    settings: {},
    componentData: {}
});
```

**Adding the component to the control tree:**

To add your newly created component into the control tree, you need to associate it with a `ComponentContainer`:

```js
// associate the component in a ComponentContainer
const oContainer = new ComponentContainer({
    component: oComponent
});
// and place it into the control tree
myView.addContent(oContainer);
```

**`ComponentContainer` with owner component:**

Instead of calling the [`Component#createComponent`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Component%23methods/createComponent) factory on a component instance, you can directly create a `ComponentContainer` and reference the reuse component via its name declared in the `manifest.json`.

This approach **only works** if you ensure that the `ComponentContainer` is instantiated within the "owner scope" of the component defining the `componentUsage`. For more information, see [The Owner Component](the-owner-component-a7a3138.md).

For more information, see the `usage` options outlined in the [API Reference for `ComponentContainer`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer%23controlProperties) and the [API Reference for `Component#runAsOwner`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Component%23methods/runAsOwner) used in the example below.

```js
// Ensure that the ComponentContainer is created in the correct owner scope!
oMyAppComponent.runAsOwner(() => {
    const oContainer = new ComponentContainer({
        usage: "myreuse"
    })
    oContainer.placeAt("target");
})
```

***

### Declarative Usage in XML Views

To declaratively create a component from within an XML view, simply place it in the XML DOM:

```
<mvc:View xmlns:mvc="sap.ui.core.mvc" xmlns:core="sap.ui.core" ...>
    <core:ComponentContainer usage="myreuse" manifest="true" />
</mvc:View>
```

> ### Note:  
> Depending on how you create the XML view, you may need to ensure that the *owner scope* is correctly set. For more information, see [The Owner Component](the-owner-component-a7a3138.md).

If your view is created programmatically and not via a routing target, you need to wrap the view's factory call in a corresponding [`Component#runAsOwner`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.ui.core.Component%23methods/runAsOwner) call:

```
oMyAppComponent.runAsOwner(() => {
    const oMyView = await XMLView.create(...);
    // add the view to the control tree
});
```

## Migration Guidelines

The OpenUI5 framework is continuously evolving to leverage modern web standards and browser capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility. To keep your applications performant, secure, and future-ready, migrating from legacy component APIs to modern alternatives is essential.

> ### Note:  
> For comprehensive guidance on modernizing your codebase, see [Best Practices for Developers](../03_Get-Started/best-practices-for-developers-28fcd55.md), which provides detailed recommendations for legacy-free OpenUI5 development.

***

### Legacy `sap.ui.component()` Factory

The legacy `sap.ui.component()` factory function creates components synchronously, which blocks the UI thread and violates Content Security Policy requirements. Migrating to asynchronous alternatives is essential for modern OpenUI5 development.

**Legacy approach:**

```js
createContent: function() {
    var oReuseComponent = sap.ui.component({
        "name": "sap.reuse.component"
    });
}
```

**Modern approach:**

```js
createContent: function() {
    var oReuseComponentPromise = this.createComponent({
        "usage": "reuse"
    });
}
```

***

### Legacy Component Dependencies

**Legacy definition in manifest.json:**

```json
{
    "sap.ui5": {
        "dependencies": {
            "components": {
                "sap.reuse.component": {}
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Modern definition in manifest.json:**

```json
{
    "sap.ui5": {
        "componentUsages": {
            "reuse": {
                "name": "sap.reuse.component",
                "lazy": false
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1.  **Always use asynchronous APIs** - use `Component.create()` instead of `sap.ui.component()`.
2.  **Prefer `ComponentSupport`** for initial components over manual `ComponentContainer` creation.
3.  **Declare reuse components** in `componentUsages` rather than in `dependencies`.
4.  **Enable async routing** in all components when using nested component routing.
5.  **Use routing with nested components** for nested components that define their own routing.
6.  **Use proper lifecycle management** via the `ComponentContainer`'s `lifecycle` property.
7.  **Leverage manifest-first** loading for optimal performance.
