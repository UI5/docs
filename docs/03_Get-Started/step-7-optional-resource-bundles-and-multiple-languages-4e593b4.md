# Step 7: \(Optional\) Resource Bundles and Multiple Languages

Resource bundles exist to enable an app to run in multiple languages without the need to change any code. To demonstrate this feature, let's create a German version of the app â€“ in fact, all we need to do is create a German version of the resource bundle file. In our code, we activate the German locale for the ResourceModel.

## webapp/i18n/i18n\_de.properties \(New\)

In the `i18n` folder, duplicate the `i18n.properties` file and rename its copy to <code>i18n<b>_de</b>.properties</code>. Replace the English text with the German text provided below. The suffix `de` represents the locale for the German language. Since the `de` locale is already set in the `supportedLocales` configuration of the `manifest.json`, it will be taken into account.

```ini
# Field labels
firstName=Vorname
lastName=Nachname
enabled=Aktiviert

# Screen titles
panelHeaderText=Data Binding Grundlagen
```

To check the result, append the `sap-language=DE` URL parameter to the URL in your browser, for example `http://localhost:port/index.html?sap-language=DE`. Once you remove this parameter, your app reverts to your browser's default language.

However, this is only true for resource models. The properties within JSON and OData models are usually arranged in a hierarchical structure. So, let's explore how to reference fields in a hierarchically structured model object.")
