# Further Extensions

We recommend using [Extension Points](extension-points-403c050.md) and [Controller Extensions](../04_Essentials/controller-extensions-21515f0.md) as the preferred standard approaches to customize applications. Consider the mechanisms below only in the following cases:

-   You need a specialized extension that toggles the visibility of controls in your custom application.
-   You need to make fundamental changes to your view or your controller's behavior, and the standard extension mechanisms aren't sufficient.

-   **[View Modification](view-modification-aa93e1c.md "View modification lets you change specific properties of controls in standard views without altering the structure of the view
		itself.")**  
View modification lets you change specific properties of controls in standard views without altering the structure of the view itself.
-   **[View Replacement](view-replacement-98861cf.md "View replacement lets you completely substitute an existing view in a standard application with your own custom implementation. This
		powerful extension mechanism gives you full control over the UI structure and behavior when other customization approaches aren't
		sufficient.")**  
View replacement lets you completely substitute an existing view in a standard application with your own custom implementation. This powerful extension mechanism gives you full control over the UI structure and behavior when other customization approaches aren't sufficient.
-   **[Controller Replacement](controller-replacement-b0b14bf.md "Controller replacement lets you completely substitute an existing controller with a custom implementation. This approach gives you full
        control over the controller logic.")**  
Controller replacement lets you completely substitute an existing controller with a custom implementation. This approach gives you full control over the controller logic.
