# Core Mechanisms for Extending Apps

The first topics in this section describe how to configure app extensions in your `manifest.json` and explain **extension points** and **controller extensions**, which are the preferred standard approaches for customizing applications.

You'll also find a section containing some further extensions. Consider these for specialized view customizations or when the standard approaches aren't sufficient.

Another topic covers your options for customizing application text.

-   **[Configuration in the manifest.json](configuration-in-the-manifest-json-c264d66.md "OpenUI5's extension configuration works through a
		Component's manifest.json file, where you define your customization logic within the
			sap.ui5/extends/extensions section. This declarative approach allows you to specify which views, controllers, or UI
		elements you want to extend or replace, without the need to modify the original application code.")**  
OpenUI5's extension configuration works through a `Component`'s `manifest.json` file, where you define your customization logic within the `sap.ui5/extends/extensions` section. This declarative approach allows you to specify which views, controllers, or UI elements you want to extend or replace, without the need to modify the original application code.
-   **[Extension Points](extension-points-403c050.md "Extension points are locations in application views where you can insert custom content. These points are pre-defined by the
        application.")**  
Extension points are locations in application views where you can insert custom content. These points are pre-defined by the application.
-   **[Controller Extensions](../04_Essentials/controller-extensions-21515f0.md "Controller extensions enable you to enhance existing controller functionality without modifying the original application code, making them
        one of the most versatile and commonly used extension mechanisms in OpenUI5. This
        approach allows you to add custom business logic, override existing methods, and integrate seamlessly with the standard controller
        lifecycle.")**  
Controller extensions enable you to enhance existing controller functionality without modifying the original application code, making them one of the most versatile and commonly used extension mechanisms in OpenUI5. This approach allows you to add custom business logic, override existing methods, and integrate seamlessly with the standard controller lifecycle.

-   **[Text Customization](text-customization-2edc3f9.md "When extending OpenUI5 applications, you often need to add custom localized
		texts or override existing ones. OpenUI5 provides flexible mechanisms for
		enhancing resource models with additional localization files, allowing you to integrate multilingual content.")**  
When extending OpenUI5 applications, you often need to add custom localized texts or override existing ones. OpenUI5 provides flexible mechanisms for enhancing resource models with additional localization files, allowing you to integrate multilingual content.
